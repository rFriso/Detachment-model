Further Information
For a more detailed description of the physics behind the script, the reader is referred to the publication:

"Towards an innovative mechanistic model to predict the detachment process of a deposited layer"

Set Up
The results will be shown by only running the Data.m script. It has to be filled with user data. The default data are relative to the publication above reported. 
The only change the user has to makes in order to reproduce the results of the paper is the name of the CFD data that will be load. Specifically, the two datasets available are:
- CFDdata90: for the normal particles impact
- CFDdata40: for the tangential particles impact.
In addition, the thicknesses have to be set. When a tangential impact occurs, max and min thickness has to be changed. When normal impact occurs, 
both max and min has to be set equals to the same value.
